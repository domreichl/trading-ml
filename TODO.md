## TODO
1. DVC tracking:
    - add metrics to dvc.yaml in main -> dvc repro in src/main
    - simplify handling of model prefixes ("prod_" etc.)
        - in .gto file
        - dev/exp
        - val/eval
        - prod/stage/forecast
    - experimentation pipeline ('dvc exp [run, show, diff]' commands) with "dev_" or "exp_" models
    - think about how to best track & compare performances with DVC:
        - [!!] use 'dvclive' (see bookmarks folder "DVCLive")
        - use DVC 'params': "start_date" & "end_date"
        - track metrics in .json-format with DVCLive (keeping the CSVs for now)
        - use DVC 'plots'
        - use DVC 'artifacts' for model metadata
    - execute the "production" for every week until End Date == 13.10.
    - new folder "src/optimization" or "src/experimentation" with dvc.yaml
    - for every week: simulate a trade & track trading performance -> update all relevant performance files
    - refactor trades.py
    - analyze the results with DVC VSCode extension
2. update cli, visualization, frontend, and readme
3. serious modeling:
    - improve all model prototypes
    - models for leveraged positions:
        - 1-4 day forecast horizon (open on Mon/Tue, sell on Fri)
        - Faktorzertifikat:
            - prediction of %return for each day --> optimize path, e.g., every day positive
            - could also be multi-day sign prediction
            - warning: make sure model are capable of predicting non-linear paths! (just just all up/down)
        - Knock-out-Zertifikat:
            - prediction of both price & voliatility
            - during validation, minimize error w.r.t. price declines (or increases for short positions)
            - during price+volatility forecast analysis, include a high penalty for potential knock-out
    - revisit my deep forecasting presentation to implement additional models
    - potential libraries: statsforecast, sktime
    - additional data sources
        - https://www.wienerborse.at/aktien-prime-market/
            - 43 prime, 22 standard, 7 direct+, 21 direct, 780 global
            - use all time series with T > LBWS
        - stick to eurozone ISINs to minimize currency risk (ATX < ATX+DAX < MSCI EMU < EMU part of Stoxx Europe 600)
    - alternative preprocessing
        - train with or without market index?
    - statistical testing for model comparision: test significance of differences in performance (e.g., RMSE) between models for n validations
